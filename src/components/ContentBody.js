        <strong>Whenever I have people over,</strong>I always do a spread.
        Sometimes it’s big. Sometimes it’s small. But I do it because it makes
        people feel adored, and people who are adored usually adore you back,
        and that’s really what life is all about. Cheese, love, adoration, and
        of course, more cheese.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is something truly magical that happens around a beautiful table
        of cheese. The typical response is “Wow, this is gorgeous. I can’t
        believe you did this for me!!” And then they nibble, talk, laugh,
        interact, ask questions, smile, and say “Mmmmmm” in between mutterings
        of, “Oh my God, this is the best cheese I‘ve ever had!!!”
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, you’ll be over there thinking, “I spent 15 minutes at the
        store, another 15 minutes cutting everything up, and these people think
        they’re at the French Laundry and I’m Thomas Keller, and I never even
        turned on the stove, HOT DAMN I’m good!”
      </p>
      <p className="important-copy">
        <FaQuoteLeft /> In this simple guide, I’ll talk about constructing a
        gorgeous spread of nourishing, wholesome, and delicious ingredients
        using a handful of cheeses and several well-chosen accompaniments like
        fruit, meats, nuts, and olives. I’ll teach you how much to buy, and how
        to serve, store, and pair accompaniments, including wines, to produce
        the cheese spread of your dreams. <FaQuoteRight />
      </p>
      <p>
        It is my wish for you to enjoy this simple guide to eating and enjoying
        delicious cheese, while creating moments and memories with your loved
        ones that will last a lifetime.
      </p>
      <h3>HOW MUCH TO BUY</h3>
      <p>
        A little bit of real cheese goes a long way! To determine how much
        cheese to purchase, consider the occasion, and choose an appropriate
        serving size. Multiply the serving weight by the number of people being
        served and buy that total weight.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong> For a tasting party including 5 guests with a
        5 cheese selection ½ oz x 5 cheeses x 5 guests = 12.5 oz cheese
      </p>
      <p>Per-Person Servings</p>
      <h3>TASTINGS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>5-10 cheeses: ½ ounce</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>APPETIZER PLATES</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>3-5 cheeses: ¾ ounce</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>MAIN COURSES</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>3-5 cheeses: 1 ¼ ounces</li>
        <li>5-10 cheeses: ⅔ ounce</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>AFTER-DINNER PLATES</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>3-5 cheeses: ¾ ounce</li>
        <li>5-10 cheeses: ½ ounce</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>STORAGE:</h3>
      <p>
        Cheeses are happiest at temperatures between 45 to 60 degrees
        Fahrenheit, with relative humidity of at least 80 percent, and moderate
        air circulation. If you don’t have access to a cool, clean, dark, fairly
        humid place in your home (a nice little corner in your basement), then
        store your cheese in the vegetable drawer of your refrigerator very
        loosely wrapped in unwaxed parchment paper and then again with a layer
        of light plastic cling wrap. This will protect the cheese, hold in
        moisture, allow for air circulation, and create enough of an air pocket
        so your precious cheese doesn’t suffocate.
      </p>
      <h3>SERVING CHEESE</h3>
      <p>
        Cheese should always be cut fresh into thin slices or wedges, never
        cubes, and served at room temperature in the range of 65 to 75 degrees
        Fahrenheit. Serving cheese straight from the fridge is one of the worst
        and most common fromage sins one can commit. Why? Chilled cheese lacks
        flavor and produces very little aroma. Let’s make a pact right now to
        always, and I mean always, take your cheese out of the fridge at least
        one hour before serving.
      </p>
      <p>
        When at all possible, use a separate knife for each cheese, or at least
        wipe your knife clean between each cut to avoid muddling those
        awe-inspiring flavors.
      </p>
      <h3>WHAT TO SERVE WITH YOUR CHEESE</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>FRUIT:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The wonderful, sweet, tender, juiciness of fresh fruit provides an ideal
        contrast to the dry salty flavor of most cheeses. Pair with thinly
        sliced apples, pears, peaches, or persimmons. Other fantastic fruit
        preparations include fresh figs, grapes, melon, and strawberries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dried fruit is another option to pre-stock in your pantry for even more
        nibbling pleasure. Dried figs, dates, peaches, plums, and apricots will
        all excite your taste buds and pave the way to cheese heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
        Serving preserves, jams, honey, and chutneys are also a wonderful way to
        enhance your favorite cheeses while complimenting and balancing all of
        those intense, savory flavors.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>MEAT:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Dry cured prosciutto di Parma, jambon de Bayonne, sopressata, capicola,
        saucisson sec, or a nice dried salami add substance and heft to any
        cheese spread. Maybe add a few briney pickles and some quality mustard
        if you have some on hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>NUTS AND OLIVES:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Try raw or toasted Spanish Marcona almonds, macadamia nuts, Brazil nuts,
        cashews, hazelnuts, pecans, or walnuts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Choose a selection of different colors, textures, and flavors of
        Mediterranean olives from your local olive bar.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>BREAD:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is cheese’s oldest and most reliable friend! A good piece of crusty
        bread is the ideal complement, but feel free to experiment with crowd
        favorites such as baguettes, sourdough, olive breads, Focaccia,
        crackers, flatbreads, or any and all gluten-free bread and cracker
        options.
      </p>
      <h3>THE CHEESE AND WINE:</h3>
      <p>
        Cheese and wine are two of life’s great simple pleasures of the culinary
        world. Real cheese is artisanal (handmade with unpasteurized milk from a
        single herd) and organic, which allows the cheese to express the
        beautiful, natural flavors of the milk from which they’re made. Typical
        cheese plates have anywhere from 3 to 5 selections, or more, depending
        on the occasion and number of guests you wish to serve.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you’ve chosen your cheeses, a quick Google search will help you
        find the perfect wine pairing for each. To keep things simple with 1 or
        2 bottles, use Champagne, Chardonnay, Riesling (off-dry), or Cabernet
        Sauvignon; all quite popular and can be easily served alongside any
        cheese plate.
      </p>
      <h6>Fresh Cheese:</h6>
      <p>
        Soft, rindless, and made with cow, goat, or sheep's milk; fresh cheeses
        are unaged and have a mild, slightly tangy flavor. In addition to that
        iconic log of bright white goat cheese, this category includes farmer’s
        cheese, ricotta, and others that come in little tubs for your indulgent
        pleasure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Try the classic Loire Valley goat cheeses such as Valencay, St. Maure,
        or Chabichou du Poitou. Just pronouncing these for your guests makes
        them all the more impressive. The US is a top contender in the goat
        cheese category. Try “Humboldt Fog” by Cypress Grove Chѐvre, “Coupole”
        from the Vermont Butter and Cheese Company, “Sofia” from Capriole Dairy,
        or “Bonne Bouche” from Vermont Creamery. Mozzarella, Buratta, Feta, and
        Ricotta are other well known, fresh cheese options for those who prefer
        to leave the more goaty options to the seasoned cheese tasters in the
        room.

      <p>
        <strong>White Wine Pairings: </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Crisp, dry and young bottles (Albariño, Soave, Pinot Blanc, Muscadet,
        Vermentino, Verdejo, Arneis, Sauvignon Blanc, young Chardonnay)
      </p>
      <p>
        Off-dry wines (Gewurztraminer or Riesling) for salty cheeses like feta
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Red Wine Pairings:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Very young, fruity, unoaked red wines (Loire Cabernet Franc, Pinot Noir,
        Gamay, Valpolicella, Zweigelt)
      </p>
      <p>Crisp, dry rosé</p>
      <h6>Bloomy or Soft Ripened Cheese: </h6>
      <p>
        Named for the glorious bloom of white mold delicately embracing the
        outside rind; soft ripened cheeses tend to be the richest and creamiest
        on the market, with a soft, spreadable texture. The bloomy exterior is
        edible, and has a stronger, funkier flavor than the creamy interior.
      </p>
      <p>
        Try Camembert, Brie, Robiola, Fromager d’ Affinois, St. Andre, Pierre
        Robert, or Brillat Savarin. Cowgirl Creamery in Northern California
        makes a wonderful triple cream Mt. Tam.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>White Wine Pairings:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Dry, traditional-method sparkling wines like brut Champagne (non-vintage
        for young cheese and vintage for riper, more pungent cheeses).
      </p>
      <p>Light-bodied, dry, unoaked Chardonnay (Chablis)</p>
      <p>Restrained, dry, light-bodied Sauvignon Blanc (Sancerre)</p>
      <p>Dry, young Riesling, dry Chenin Blanc (Vouvray), Grüner Veltliner</p>
      <p>
        Aged Hunter Valley Semillon or textured white Rhône varieties (Marsanne
        and Roussanne, specifically Châteauneuf-du-Pape Blanc) for ripe, pungent
        cheese
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Red Wine Pairings:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Dry and light-bodied wines that are young, fruity and unoaked (Pinot
        Noir, Dolcetto, Barbera, Gamay, Cabernet Franc from the Loire, Bonarda,
        Mencía, Zweigelt)
      </p>
      <h6>Washed Rind Cheese: </h6>
      <p>
        After a bath in brine, beer, or wine, a distinctive nutty orange tinted
        rind is produced. Washed rind cheeses are rich and creamy, and can be
        soft or semi-soft in texture. These beauties are notably funkier than
        bloomy cheeses, with pleasantly pungent tasting notes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Époisses, Fontina, Reblochon, Limburger, Appenzeller, Taleggio,
        Winnimere, or Petit Livarot are all top choices in this category.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>White Wine Pairings:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Dry, traditional-method sparkling wines (brut Franciacorta, brut
        California bottlings)
      </p>
      <p>
        Dry and off-dry, unoaked white wines (Gewurztraminer and Pinot Gris from
        Alsace, Chenin Blanc from the Loire)
      </p>
      <p>
        Dry, structured whites (Marsanne and Roussanne, mature Hunter Valley
        Semillon, Riesling from Clare or Eden Valley, Australia) for ripe,
        pungent cheese
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Red Wine Pairings:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Beaujolais Villages</p>
      <p>Pinot Noir</p>
      <p>Poulsard or Trousseau from Jura</p>
      <h6>Semi-Soft Cheese:</h6>
      <p>
        Not spreadable, and incapable of breaking into shards like a hard
        cheese, semi-soft cheeses tend to be creamy with fairly mild flavoring.
        Many are excellent for melting and produce a perfect slice. Some cheeses
        like Gouda are semi-soft in younger styles, however when aged, a harder
        texture is produced.
      </p>
      <p>
        Try Gouda, Havarti, Muenster, Port Salut, Taleggio, Tomme de Savoie, or
        Vacherin.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>White Wine Pairings:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Dry, white wines with a touch of oak (Chardonnay, Pinot Gris, Rioja)
      </p>
      <p>Condrieu</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Red Wine Pairings: </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Rustic wines without much oak (Côtes de Rhône, Corbières, St-Chinian,
        Chianti, Mencía, young Bordeaux blends)
      </p>
      <h6>Hard Cheese:</h6>
      <p>
        These beauties, aged to perfection, are quite firm and break into
        wonderfully chunky crumbles or shards. Hard cheeses tend to possess
        nutty and complex savory notes, while some are fairly pungent or salty.
      </p>
      <p>
        Try Cheddar, Manchego, Parmigiano Reggiano, Beaufort, Cantal, Emmental,
        Comté, Pecorino, Double Gloucester, Cantal, Gruyère, or Mimolette.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>White Wine Pairings:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Vintage traditional method sparkling wines (Champagne, Franciacorta) for
        younger cheese
      </p>
      <p>Sherry (Amontillado, Palo Cortado)</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Red Wine Pairings:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Bold wines with some age (Nebbiolo, Sangiovese, Aglianico, Rioja or
        Bordeaux blends from cooler climates like Bordeaux or Margaret River)
      </p>
      <h6>Blue Cheese: </h6>
      <p>
        Veins of distinctive blue penicillium mold run through these rich,
        aromatic cheeses. Blues come in two forms: soft and creamy, or semi-soft
        and crumbly. Some are sweeter and milder, but all pack a great deal of
        sharpness and tang.
      </p>
      <p>
        Roquefort, Bleu d’ Auvergne, Gorgonzola, Stilton, Cabrales, or Valdeon.
        Try the American made “Bayley Hazen Blue” from Jasper Hill Farm in
        Vermont or the “Smokey Blue” from Rogue Creamery in Oregon.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>White Wine Pairings:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Milder blue cheeses like Cambozola share the same potential matches as
        bloomy cheeses
      </p>
      <p>
        Noble Rot sweet wines (Sauternes, Barsac, Monbazillac, Riesling
        Beerenauslese, and Trockenbeerenauslese, Quarts de Chaume) for sharp,
        salty cheese.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dessert wines from dried grapes (Vin Santo, Jurançon, Recioto di Soave)
      </p>
      <p>
        Late-harvest wines (Riesling Spätlese or Gewurztraminer Vendanges
        Tardives) for cheeses which are not overtly pungent
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Red Wine Pairings:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Sweet, fortified reds (Vintage Port, LBV Port, Maury, Banyuls)</p>
      <p>
        <em>
          Note: If you’re simply not a fan of blue cheese, add a second crowd
          pleasing hard cheese. Chunks of Parmigiano Reggiano with a drizzle of
          honey are a classic pairing made in Heaven.
